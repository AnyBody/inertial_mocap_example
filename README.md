# Inertial based Mocap Model

Example of how to create a inertial based motion caputure (MOCAP) model. This example is based on a BVH file recorded with the Xsens system. 

The represents a rough example of the how the this can be accomplished. The plan is to inlcude inertial MOCAP into the new framework for mocap models (see https://github.com/anybody/anymocap).
